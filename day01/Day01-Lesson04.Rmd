* What data are out there for districts, buildings/schools? 

* If we need to gather student-level data, how can we do that? 2 Examples 

* What might a complete student-level data file look like?

**(1) Needs-driven & Context-specific**

* Use an **organizing framework** that defines the problems, topics, and questions to be addressed 

    * One Example: [Four Domains for Rapid School Improvement](http://centeronschoolturnaround.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CST_Four-Domains-Framework-Final.pdf) 
    
    * Another Example: Bake your own organizing framework!  

* Stay anchored to your **local context** 

    * What local factors are causing the problem(s)? 
    
    * What local factors could impede the solution(s)?

**(2) Rigorous Data Analysis**

* Use multiple sources and types of high quality data (qualitative versus quantitative) 

    * **High Quality:** Data must be gathered via reliable techniques and processes 

* Balance the data you are gathering ...

    * **Input data:** information related to improvement plans, curriculum materials and supplies, training, resource allocation, and intervention programs 
    
    * **Output data:** illustrates outcomes or results and could include student and teacher attendance, student achievement, program reviews, classroom observations, behavior referrals, and so forth 
    
    * **Community Context data:** factors that the district or school likely does not have the power to change but that may affect implementation of interventions

**(3) Stakeholder Engagement** 

* Let **local stakeholders** drive the needs assessment, not a few leaders or an outside consultant 

* **Involve** school staff, parents, even students (higher grades of course), local influencers (*but not the Kardashians*), business community 

* Involvement should be in **all aspects and phases** of the needs assessment ... you will get buy-in, their sustained support, and trust in what you are trying to do

**(4) Collaborative Identification of Improvement Needs** 

* Needs assessment should lead to a set of **identified needs, prioritized areas of focus** 

* Stakeholder-driven, very **collaborative identification** of improvement needs means everyone sees themselves in the data, increasing ownership and understanding of the process 

* Such a collaborative-approach **shifts mindsets** from a "mutually agreeable" approach to a "mutually beneficial" approach, building a team that recognizes the challenges but wants to move forward as one

**Needs-Driven and Context-Specific Approach**

* .heatinline[Compare data sources] to the guiding questions and overarching topic framework to ensure that all included data respond to the needs assessment purpose and can be triangulated with other data sources. 

* Include .heatinline[data that describe the climate and culture] of the organization and community. 

* If looking at comparison data, consider other school districts and/or communities with .heatinline[similar demographics or organizational structures].


* Identify and consider .heatinline[contextual information needed to understand the data or limitations in the data] to avoid spurious or unrelated inferences about the data

**Rigorous Data Analysis**

* .heatinline[Disaggregate data wherever possible] to help identify areas of need that otherwise may not be apparent. Consider the following: 
    * Demographics (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender) 
    * Exceptional students (e.g., students with disabilities, gifted students, low-achieving students) 
    * Students with additional needs (e.g., students in foster care; those who are homeless or migratory; and/or those whose families are highly mobile, such as military families)

* .heatinline[Aggregate observation] data by grade level or grade band and perception data by stakeholder group.


* .heatinline[Include longitudinal data (when possible)] to aid in identifying any trends over time.


* .heatinline[Create visuals] (charts, tables, graphs) to help the reader digest information presented.


* .heatinline[Allow for reflection] without assuming cause before data are triangulated across multiple sources.

**Stakeholder Engagement** 

* .heatinline[Build stakeholdersâ€™ capacity to make informed decisions] by engaging them in data collection, defining unfamiliar terminology, avoiding jargon, and ensuring access to necessary background information. 

* .heatinline[Ensure stakeholders understand data] used in the needs assessment, and display data in formats that are easy to interpret and analyze. 

* .heatinline[Encourage authentic engagement] by setting clear expectations for participation, facilitate dialogue rather than presenting information in a lecture-style format, and commit to finding answers collaboratively.

**Collaborative Identification of Improvement Needs**

When preparing and organizing data to present, .heatinline[consider all stakeholders who will have a role in Interpreting Information and Prioritizing Needs], as well as the processes that will be used to complete these later steps. 

It is important to ensure that .heatinline[data presentation is clear and accessible] for the intended audience.

Select and use readily available and relevant data sources. Determine additional data needed. Sources to consider include the following: 

* Assessment results, community demographics, student and teacher attendance, and behavior referrals 

* Data from classrooms, after-school programs, and summer programs 

* Surveys, interviews, and/or focus groups to gather perceptions from diverse groups, such as parents, educators, students, and community members 

* Review of relevant district and school policies, plans, and allocation of resources

]

#### .heat[If you must gather your own data ...]

.medium[
* Administrative records (maintained by school or district central office)

    * Attendance, discipline, mobility, turnover, student/staff demographics, etc.

* Surveys (you deploy) 

    * Students, staff, parents, stakeholders

* Focus Groups (you deploy)

    * Students, staff, parents, stakeholders

* Assessments of academic performance (you deploy)

    * Short-cycle assessments 
    * Other assessments you devise

#### .heat[Two examples of an intake form] 

.medium[

* Look in your Teamâ€™s folder on Scarlet and open Two PDFs ... 

    * An Ohio Example: [An Absenteeism Intervention Team Planning Checklist](https://www.escneo.org/Downloads/Absence%20Intervention%20Team%20and%20Plan%20Template2.pdf) 
    
    * An Illinois Example: [A Student Attendance Intervention Plan](https://www.escneo.org/Downloads/Student%20Attendance%20Intervention%20Plan%20-%20Illinois2.pdf) 

* However you gather whatever data you gather, if it is student-level data, it should be setup something like .heatinline[typical-student-level-data-setup.xlsx]

    * A folder with your stateâ€™s name â€¦ containing a few Excel files
    
    * A PDF called **Links to Data provided by your state.pdf**

* Open the PDF ... 
    * There may be more than one link provided 
    
    * The link in red is to a specific page that has hyperlinks to various data
    
    * The other link(s) are to higher-level/main pages for Reports and Data 

* .heatinline[Follow the link in red and explore what data you see there.] Look for your school or district, and then another "peer" school/district. Note what indicators you see collected by the state, which are new to you and which are familiar?
